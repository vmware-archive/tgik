                      value. The currently valid values are shown below, but new values
                      may be added over time. This field is always present in a condition.
                      \n All codes that begin with the prefix `Crit` indicate that
                      all HNC activities (e.g. propagating objects, updating labels)
                      have been paused in this namespaces. HNC will resume updating
                      the namespace once the condition has been resolved. Non-critical
                      conditions typically indicate some kind of error that HNC itself
                      can ignore, but likely indicates that the hierarchical structure
                      is out-of-sync with the users' expectations. \n If the validation
                      webhooks are working properly, there should typically not be
                      any conditions on any namespaces, although some may appear transiently
                      when the HNC controller is restarted. These should quickly resolve
                      themselves (<30s). However, validation webhooks are not perfect,
                      especially if multiple users are modifying the same namespace
                      trees quickly, so it's important to monitor for critical conditions
                      and resolve them if they arise. See the user guide for more
                      information. \n Currently, the supported values are: \n - \"CritParentMissing\":
                      the specified parent is missing and the namespace is an orphan.
                      \n - \"CritCycle\": the namespace is a member of a cycle. For
                      example, if namespace B says that its parent is namespace A,
                      but namespace A says that its parent is namespace B, then A
                      and B are in a cycle with each other and both of them will have
                      the CritCycle condition. \n - \"CritDeletingCRD\": The HierarchyConfiguration
                      CRD is being deleted. No more objects will be propagated into
                      or out of this namespace. It is expected that the HNC controller
                      will be stopped soon after the CRDs are fully deleted. \n -
                      \"CritAncestor\": a critical error exists in an ancestor namespace,
                      so this namespace is no longer being updated either. \n - \"SubnamespaceAnchorMissing\":
                      this namespace is a subnamespace, but the anchor referenced
                      in its `subnamespaceOf` annotation does not exist in the parent.
                      \n - \"CannotPropagateObject\": this namespace contains an object
                      that couldn't be propagated *out* of this namespace, to one
                      or more of this namespace's descendants. If the object couldn't
                      be propagated to *any* descendants - for example, because it
                      has a finalizer on it (HNC can't propagate objects with finalizers),
                      the `Affects` field will point to the object in this namespace.
                      Otherwise, if it couldn't be propagated to *some* descendants,
                      `Affects` will contain a list of the objects in those descendants
                      that couldn't be created or updated. \n - \"CannotUpdateObject\":
                      this namespace has an object that couldn't be propagated *into*
                      this namespace - that is, it couldn't be created in the first
                      place, or it couldn't be updated. The `Affects` field will point
                      to the source object, which will always be in a namespace that's
                      an ancestor of this namespace."
