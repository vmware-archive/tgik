# waypoint-examples

You can use these example applications to quickly try out and learn how to use
[Waypoint](https://waypointproject.io/).

## Getting Started

If you're new to Waypoint, start by reviewing the [Getting
Started](https://waypointproject.io/docs/getting-started) page, which includes
guided tutorials and quickstart installation and deployment instructions.

All guided tutorials use applications in this repository.

Detailed tutorials with instructions for provisioning each cloud resource are at
[HashiCorp Learn](https://learn.hashicorp.com/waypoint).

## How the Examples are Organized

All of the examples in this repository are organized first by deployment
platform and then by programming language or web platform. For example:
**Docker/nodejs**.

## Deploying Examples

You can experiment with the different examples by entering each directory and
running `waypoint init` followed by `waypoint up`.
